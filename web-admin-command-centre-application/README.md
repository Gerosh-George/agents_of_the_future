# Dhristi Admin Command Center Dashboard

This is a modern React (Vite) web application for the Dhristi project, designed for Admin users in a command center. It provides real-time monitoring, actionable insights, and effective data visualization for large-scale crowd and incident management.

## Features

- **Crowd Monitoring & Insights**: Visualizes crowd density and movement velocity by zone, highlights critical areas, allows admin to assign helpers, and predicts future chaos with planning options.
- **Alerts**: Displays health, safety, and fire/emergency alerts, with quick actions to notify the nearest responders (health booths, police guards, fire stations).
- **Incident Monitoring**: Dashboard to track the status of all raised alerts and incidents in real time.
- **Anomaly Behaviour**: Surfaces suspicious or odd behavior detected from footage, with video clips for review.
