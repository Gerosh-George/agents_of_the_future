# Crowd Event Management and Monitoring Agentic AI System

**USP:** Our system leverages Agentic AI to provide real-time, proactive, and intelligent crowd management and monitoring, offering unparalleled insights and automated responses for enhanced safety and efficiency at large-scale events.

## Project Details

This project encompasses two main components:

1.  **UI Mobile Application (ui-mobile):** A Flutter-based mobile application for crowd monitoring and related functionalities. Key features include:
    *   Crowd Monitoring & Insights
    *   Alerts (Health, Safety, Fire/Emergency)
    *   Incident Monitoring
    *   Anomaly Behaviour Detection

    The mobile application is built with Flutter.

2.  **Web Admin Command Centre Application (web-admin-command-centre-application):** A React (Vite) web application designed for Admin users in a command center. It provides a comprehensive dashboard for real-time monitoring, actionable insights, and data visualization for crowd and incident management. Key features include:
    *   Crowd Monitoring & Insights (visualization of crowd density and movement, critical area highlighting, helper assignment, chaos prediction)
    *   Alerts (displaying various alert types with quick responder notification)
    *   Incident Monitoring (real-time tracking of alerts and incidents)
    *   Anomaly Behaviour (surfacing suspicious behavior with video clips)

    The web application is built with React (Vite) and Modern CSS.
